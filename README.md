- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on using Optimizing Enoxaparin Prophylaxis Dosing in ICU Patients with Brain Trauma Using LLM Guidance

Patients in the ICU with brain trauma present a unique challenge when adjusting standard enoxaparin prophylaxis dosing. These patients are at heightened risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to immobility, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability. However, they also face an elevated risk of intracranial bleeding, complicating prophylaxis decisions.

Clinical practice often delays pharmacologic prophylaxis, such as enoxaparin, until the risk of hemorrhage stabilizes. This stabilization period typically falls between 24 to 72 hours post-injury, guided by imaging findings and neurosurgical input.

For certain high-risk groups, such as older adults and patients with brain contusions, further caution is advised. In these cases, waiting beyond the standard timeframe may be recommended, depending on findings from MRI studies and the evolving clinical picture.

Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the precision of enoxaparin dosing adjustments by integrating real-time patient data, risk stratification models, and updated clinical guidelines. This approach can support clinicians in balancing the risks of VTE with the risk of intracranial bleeding, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
